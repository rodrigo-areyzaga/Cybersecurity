# Cybersecurity Learning Log

This repository is a structured archive of my cybersecurity education.

It documents milestones, key concepts, and reflections as I progress from foundational topics toward deeper technical practice. Each entry serves as a timestamped marker of growth — a record of what I studied, what I understood, and how my perspective evolves over time.

## Purpose

* Build disciplined documentation habits
* Reinforce learning through reflection
* Create a transparent timeline of technical progress
* Track the transition from fundamentals to applied cybersecurity

## Structure

Entries are organized chronologically and grouped by platform or subject area. Each log includes:

* A concise summary of the topic
* Key concepts reviewed
* Personal reflection on learning outcomes

## Current Focus

* Cryptography foundations (TryHackMe)
* Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
* Expanding practical cybersecurity skills

*A living archive. A silent witness to progress.*
