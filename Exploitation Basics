## Learning Log — Moniker Link Exploit

**Platform:** TryHackMe
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time spent:** ~1 hour (including troubleshooting)

### Summary

Completed the *Moniker Link* room. The task focused on exploiting a vulnerability involving the Windows MonikerLink mechanism and capturing authentication attempts using Responder. The core concept was straightforward, but the troubleshooting phase reminded me that execution details matter.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Understanding the **MonikerLink vulnerability**
* Using **Responder** to capture authentication hashes
* Triggering outbound authentication requests
* Recognizing patched vs. unpatched attack surfaces
* Importance of environment setup before testing exploits

### Reflection

This room took longer than expected — not because of complexity, but because I forgot to turn **Responder** on. A simple oversight stalled progress until I stepped back and reviewed the setup. Once corrected, the exploit worked as intended.

The lesson: before assuming something is broken, verify the fundamentals. Tools don’t work if they’re not running.

It’s reassuring to know this vulnerability has already been patched by Microsoft. Still, understanding how it worked provides valuable insight into how authentication abuse can occur in real-world environments.

On to the next challenge.
