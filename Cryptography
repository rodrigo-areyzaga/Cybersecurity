## Learning Log — Cryptography Foundations 🔐

Today I completed **Cryptography Basics**, **Public Key Cryptography Basics**, and **Hashing Basics** on TryHackMe.

This session focused on understanding the foundations of how data is protected: how encryption transforms information, how public and private keys enable secure communication, and how hashing preserves integrity. What stood out most is how these concepts connect — they are not isolated topics, but parts of a larger system that quietly secures everyday digital life.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Difference between **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**
* Role of **public and private keys** in secure communication
* Basic intuition behind **RSA and key exchange**
* Core properties of **cryptographic hash functions** (determinism, irreversibility, integrity)
* How hashing supports **data verification and authentication**
* Practical relevance of cryptography in modern security systems

This entry serves as a marker of progress. Each module completed is another step toward building practical intuition in cybersecurity — moving from abstract ideas to tools I can recognize and eventually apply.
