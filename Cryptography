## Learning Log — Cryptography Foundations 🔐

Today I completed **Cryptography Basics**, **Public Key Cryptography Basics**, and **Hashing Basics** on TryHackMe.

This session focused on understanding the foundations of how data is protected: how encryption transforms information, how public and private keys enable secure communication, and how hashing preserves integrity. What stood out most is how these concepts connect — they are not isolated topics, but parts of a larger system that quietly secures everyday digital life.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Difference between **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**
* Role of **public and private keys** in secure communication
* Basic intuition behind **RSA and key exchange**
* Core properties of **cryptographic hash functions** (determinism, irreversibility, integrity)
* How hashing supports **data verification and authentication**
* Practical relevance of cryptography in modern security systems

This entry serves as a marker of progress. Each module completed is another step toward building practical intuition in cybersecurity — moving from abstract ideas to tools I can recognize and eventually apply.

## Learning Log — John the Ripper Fundamentals

**Platform:** TryHackMe
**Date:** Feb 5, 2026

### Summary

Completed the *Introduction*, *Basic Terms*, *Setting Up Your System*, and *Cracking Basic Hashes* modules focused on John the Ripper. This session emphasized hands-on hash cracking and the importance of correctly identifying hash formats before attempting attacks.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Core terminology and workflow of **John the Ripper**
* Environment setup for password cracking tasks
* Identifying hash types before running cracking attempts
* Using external tools (e.g., hash identifier resources) to verify formats
* Practical use of John with the correct `--format` option

### Reflection

The final whirlpool hash took a long time to crack because I initially ran John with an incorrect format (SHA-512, cryptosafe). Spending hours without results was frustrating, but it pushed me to investigate methodically. Instead of copying solutions, I searched for clues and discovered a hash identification resource that helped me confirm the correct format. Running John with `--format=whirlpool` resolved the issue.

The main lesson: skimming terminal output is a liability at this stage. Careful observation and thoroughness matter more than speed. Precision builds proficiency — speed follows later.
