## Learning Log — Cryptography Foundations 🔐

Today I completed **Cryptography Basics**, **Public Key Cryptography Basics**, and **Hashing Basics** on TryHackMe.

This session focused on understanding the foundations of how data is protected: how encryption transforms information, how public and private keys enable secure communication, and how hashing preserves integrity. What stood out most is how these concepts connect — they are not isolated topics, but parts of a larger system that quietly secures everyday digital life.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Difference between **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**
* Role of **public and private keys** in secure communication
* Basic intuition behind **RSA and key exchange**
* Core properties of **cryptographic hash functions** (determinism, irreversibility, integrity)
* How hashing supports **data verification and authentication**
* Practical relevance of cryptography in modern security systems

This entry serves as a marker of progress. Each module completed is another step toward building practical intuition in cybersecurity — moving from abstract ideas to tools I can recognize and eventually apply.

## Learning Log — John the Ripper Fundamentals

**Platform:** TryHackMe
**Date:** Feb 5, 2026
**Difficulty:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Time spent:** ~4–5 hours (including troubleshooting)

### Summary

Completed the *Introduction*, *Basic Terms*, *Setting Up Your System*, and *Cracking Basic Hashes* modules focused on John the Ripper. This session emphasized hands-on hash cracking and the importance of correctly identifying hash formats before attempting attacks.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Core terminology and workflow of **John the Ripper**
* Environment setup for password cracking tasks
* Identifying hash types before running cracking attempts
* Using external tools (e.g., hash identifier resources) to verify formats
* Practical use of John with the correct `--format` option

### Reflection

The final whirlpool hash took a long time to crack because I initially ran John with an incorrect format (SHA-512, cryptosafe). Spending hours without results was frustrating, but it pushed me to investigate methodically. Instead of copying solutions, I searched for clues and discovered a hash identification resource that helped me confirm the correct format. Running John with `--format=whirlpool` resolved the issue.

The main lesson: skimming terminal output is a liability at this stage. Careful observation and thoroughness matter more than speed. Precision builds proficiency — speed follows later.

## Learning Log — John the Ripper: The Basics (Completion)

**Platform:** TryHackMe
**Date:** Feb 10, 2026
**Difficulty:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Time spent:** ~2 hours (including troubleshooting)

### Summary

Completed Tasks 5–12 of *John the Ripper: The Basics*, expanding hands-on experience with password cracking across multiple real-world formats. This session reinforced how different authentication systems store credentials and how John adapts to each case. I’m still developing intuition around hash identification, but the fundamentals are starting to connect — and that emphasis on *basics* feels intentional. This was genuinely enjoyable work: seeing behind the scenes of password security makes the learning feel tangible and motivating.

### Key concepts reviewed

* Cracking **Windows authentication hashes**
* Working with **/etc/shadow password hashes**
* Using **Single Crack Mode**
* Creating and applying **custom rules**
* Cracking **password-protected ZIP archives**
* Cracking **password-protected RAR archives**
* Cracking **SSH keys with John**
* Exploring additional references and further reading

### Reflection

Hash identification remains the area that needs the most repetition, but progress is visible. Each exercise strengthens pattern recognition and workflow familiarity. There’s a real sense of momentum — learning how password systems work from the inside is both technically engaging and deeply satisfying. With this module complete, I’m moving forward to the next challenge: *Moniker Link*, which is still unknown territory and part of the appeal.

### Learning Signals

* **Effort:** 3/5
* **Clarity:** 3/5
* **Frustration:** 2/5
* **Confidence:** 3/5
